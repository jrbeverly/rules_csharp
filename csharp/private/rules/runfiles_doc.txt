# Here is the design


We pass out three components
    runtime
    compiler
    tool

Document the above cases

    the tool is the executable and the runfiles themselves.
    We then take this an bundle it into a wrapper rule (execv)
    This can then merge the runfiles together
    and call the executable as a side-effect of the runfiles.

    Maybe write a bash script that will do the work
